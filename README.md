# Feed Reader Testing
This is the fourth project from the **Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It's a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and my challenge was to **complete the test suite** using **Jasmine**.

Practicing **TTD (Test-Driven Development)** is a good way to guide your development process, as it allows you to create a testable software at the forefront. By the time you're done with development, you already have a tested software that can be pushed to production and that will certainly work.

## Process
1. In the first test, I used the `forEach` method to loop within the `allFeeds` object and check if there was an `url` element defined in the array. I used the `toBeDefined` and `not.toBe` expectations to check the declaration and existence of the element.
2. The second test was basically the same, but this time I wanted to check the `name` element inside the array.
3. In the third test, I accessed the `body` element using the document object with the `hasClass` method, to check if the element had the `menu-hidden` CSS class set by default.
4. The fourth test was about using `if` conditional statements, to expect the existence of the `menu-hidden` class on the `body` element when we use the `click()` event and, with that, the menu visibility change.
5. In the Initial Entries test suite, I used the `beforeEach` hook and asynchronous `done()` function so that I could check if the `.entry` element, combined with the `length` property, would correctly answer the `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)` expectation.
6. For the last, and most difficult test suite, I reused the same hook and asynchronous function from the previous test and added a second hook using `afterEach`, with a comparing `not.toEqual` expectation between two different variable instances of the same element.
